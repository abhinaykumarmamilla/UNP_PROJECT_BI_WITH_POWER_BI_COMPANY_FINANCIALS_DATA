# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

I collaborated with UNP to develop a Power BI dashboard for comprehensive financial performance analysis. This involved data import, transformation, modeling, and advanced calculations using DAX. The dashboard tracks key metrics such as total revenue, total profit, profit margin, total orders, and total discounts. It identifies profitable products, assesses discount impacts, and highlights cost optimization opportunities. Interactive visualizations, including charts, graphs, and slicers, enable data-driven decision-making to enhance profitability and financial strategies.
